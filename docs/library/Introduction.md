# Nominatim Frontend as a Library

The Nominatim search frontend can directly be used as a Python library in
scripts and applications. When you have imported your own Nominatim database,
then it is no longer necessary to run a full web service for it and access
the database through http requests. With the Nominatim library it is possible
to access all search functionality directly from your Python code. There are
also less constraints on the kinds of data that can be accessed. The library
allows to get access to more detailed information about the objects saved
in the database.
